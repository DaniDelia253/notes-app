# notes-app

This is a personal project I am creating to practice/showcase my development in C#/.NET.

At the recommendation of a mentor, I created the API without entity framework or any ORMs so I could get a really good understanding of how the framework interacts with the database. 

I am currently working on refactoring the backend to be more concise and follow best practices, as well as developing an angular frontend to allow full functionality!
