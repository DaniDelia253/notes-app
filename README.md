# notes-app

This is a personal project I am creating to practice/showcase my development in C#/.NET.

Currently I am working in the API folder to create an API that allows me to read and write to/from a MySQL database in AWS RDS. the database holds user information as well as the notes associated with each user. The controller logic will facilitate CRUD opperations on the data in the database, as well as implementing registration and log-in functionality using password hashing and JWT.

Future development will include creating a React front end for the app.
